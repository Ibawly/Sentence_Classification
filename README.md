# Final project for post-graduate class Open Source Linux Software(WHU)
## Introduction
We have built a novel project of machine learning. Specificly it belongs to sentence classification, which is a substaintial and key task in 
many Natural Language Processing(NLP), such as sentiment analysis, text entailment and entity-relation extraction. We utilized two kinds of
dataset as data source to be classified. One is made by ourselves and they're sentences which are extracted from listed company annoucements by keywords and
may express relation among indutries, the other is a public dataset for sentiment classification published by Yelp.
